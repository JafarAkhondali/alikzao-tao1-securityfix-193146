This is a Title
===============
That has a paragraph about a main subject and is set when the '='
is at least the same length of the title itself.

Introduction
------------
This asynchronous framework with a modular structure like Django. But with mongodb, websockets, and more than a simple barrier to entry.

Framework Installation and deployment
-------------------------------------
pip install tao1

create project
utils.py -p name

create app
utils.py -a name


Subtitles are set with '-' and are required to have the same length 
of the subttitle itself, just like titles.

 * Item Foo
 * Item Bar

Or automatically numbered:

 #. Item 1
 #. Item 2

Inline Markup
-------------
Words can have *emphasis in italics* or be **bold** and you can
define code samples with back quotes, like when you talk about a 
command: ``sudo`` gives you super user powers! 

This is an example on how to link images:
